As part of this initial four part series we will accomplish a few key goals:

== Setup local development environment

Provision and install a local Kubernetes cluster on a mac via homebrew, intended for use as a local development environment for developers to initially gain familiarity with the base Kubernetes constructs. As the developer matures the local environment can be used to develop and test functionality release in the latest branches of the main Kubernetes project.

=== Install homebrew and cask

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Details are available at https://brew.sh/

=== Install VirtualBox

    brew cask install virtualbox

=== Install minikube

    brew cask install minikube

=== Install Kubectl CLI

    brew install kubernetes-cli

=== Start minikube

We are using the VirtualBox driver which is the default selection for minikube, if you would like you can use an alternate supported component (xhyve driver or VMware Fusion) using the ```--vm-driver=xxx``` flag. For this walkthrough with VirtualBox use:

    minikube start


This will deploy a local Kubernetes 1.7.x cluster that you can interact with to start developing and testing your application against. If you see the following output you should be good to go:

image::start-minikube.png[startMiniKube]

=== Check status

Check the status of minikube to get the status of your local Kubernetes cluster:

    minikube status

If your output looks like below, everything should be ready to start working with:

image::status-minikube.png[statusMiniKube]

== Kubernetes basic commands

In this part we will familiarize ourselves with the `kubectl` cli tool and basic Kubernetes commands. We will first deploy a basic nginx pod and execute some commands to help developers gain comfort with the Kubernetes environment from an end-user perspective. This helps gets developers up and running taking advantage of the Kubernetes application deployment capabilities without having to worry about the infrastructure related complexities.

=== Basic kubectl commands

Now that we have a local cluster up and running we can start issuing some basic commands and deploy some simple resources.

Note that the kubectl commands below will be routed via your virtualbox network interface. If you are using a VPN or have a local firewall, this may prevent kubectl from contacting the minikube endpoint. Stopping the VPN or adding a firewall rule may resolve this.

==== Display nodes

This command will show all of the nodes available in your kubernetes cluster:

    kubectl get nodes

==== Display pods

This command shows all of the pods that are deployed into your cluster (into the default namespace), initially this will not show anything:

    kubectl get pods

==== Display pods in specifc namespace

This command, similar to the one above will show all of the pods in the kube-system namespace:

    kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system

==== Create your first pod

This command creates an nginx pod into your cluster:

    kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

Check for running pods in your cluster:

    kubectl get pods

You see see additional details by running this command, replace the podxxx with the name of a pod from the above output:

    kubectl describe pod podxxx

==== Shell to a running pod

This command will open a tty to a shell in your pod:

    kubectl get pods
    kubectl exec -it nameOutputFromAbove -- /bin/bash

==== Expose pod

This command will expose the nginx pod to a node port, we will talk about service in more detail in following posts but this will allow us see the nginx home page:

    kubectl expose pod pod-xxx --type=NodePort --name=demo

Where `pod-xxx` is the pod name of your nginx pod

==== View service webpage

This minukube command will display the service for you in a web page:

    minkube service demo

As you will notice it opened a browser with an IP address and the port that the service was exposed on, this is a nice feature of minukube. But what if you wanted to find this information yourself?

You can view the IP address of a node in your cluser with these steps, first find all of the nodes in your cluster:

    kubectl get nodes

Once you have the nodes (in minikubes case there will be only one), we can describe all of the attribute of that node with:

    kubectl describe node node-xxx

Where node-xxx is the output from the previous command. This shows alot of information we are not interested in. Instead just grep for the external IP address:

    kubectl describe node node-xxx | grep InternalIP

Great, now we have the ip address for the node. Now we need to get the port that the service is exposed on. We can retrieve that with:

    kubectl describe service demo

Under the section 'NodePort' you will see which port on the node the service is deployed. So now you have both the IP address and the port and you can either curl that or open it up in a browser

==== Kube dashboard

The last item we will take a look as is the kube dashboard which displays some basic information about your cluster:

    minukube dashboard

Browse around and become familiar with some the of kubernetes terminology which we will dig into deeper in the following tutorials.

Let's create a Kubernetes cluster as explained in link:../cluster-install[Install Kubernetes cluster using Kops].
