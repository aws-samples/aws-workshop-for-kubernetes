This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a Kubernetes development environment using https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/[AWS Cloud9].  This will provide you with a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that will let you write, run and debug containerized workloads with just a web browser.

=== Create AWS Cloud9 Environment
==== Option 1: AWS Cloud9 Console
1. Log into the AWS Cloud9 Console by visiting https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create

2. Provide a name for your environment.  Feel free to use something simple, such as `kubernetes-developmet`.  Then click "Next Step".


3. Change the "Instance Type" to `t2.small (2 GiB RAM + 1 vCPU)`.

4. Expand the "Network settings (advanced)" section and make sure you are using the default VPC.  It will have "(default)" next to the name.  If you do not have a default VPC listed, it is recommended that you create a "Single Public Subnet" VPC by clicking the "Create new VPC" button and following the wizard it presents.

5. If everything is correct, click the "Next Step" button.

6. Review the configuration to ensure everything is correct and then click the "Create environment" button.

This will close the wizard and you will be taken to a screen informing you that your new AWS Cloud9 environment is being created.  Once this is completed, the IDE will open to the following screen:

Your environment is now ready to be setup for working with Kubernetes and the rest of this workshop.

=== Setup Environment

Your AWS Cloud9 environment comes with many useful tools preinstalled, but there are still a few tweaks to these and additional tools you will need to support working with Kubernetes.

==== Configure the AWS CLI

Your AWS Cloud9 environment comes with the AWS CLI preinstalled and configured to automatically use the credentials of the currently logged in user.

.Please Note
*********************
It is not recommended that you change the default AWS CLI config in your AWS Cloud9 environment. Instead, it is recommended that you provide the logged in user's account the permissions needed to make any requests needed by your project.  More information on this can be found by visiting: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/credentials.html[Calling AWS Services from an Environment in AWS Cloud9]
*********************

For the sake of this workshop, we are going to configure the AWS CLI on your AWS Cloud9 environment using the AWS Configure command.  For this, use the same credentials you created in the "Create admin user and group" section of the https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes/blob/master/prereqs.adoc[Prerequesites] page.

  $ aws configure
  AWS Access Key ID [None]: *****
  AWS Secret Access Key [None]: *****
  Default region name [None]: eu-central-1
  Default output format [None]:


==== Verify Docker Version

Docker is preinstalled.  You can verify the version by running the following:

  docker --version

This will output the following or newer version:

  Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build 3dfb8343b139d6342acfd9975d7f1068b5b1c3d3

==== Install Kubectl CLI

Install the Kubectl CLI:

    $ curl -Lo kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.8.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

Add kubectl autocompletion to your current shell:

    $ source <(kubectl completion bash)

You can verify that kubectl is installed by executing the following command:

  kubectl version

This should output something similar to the follow:

  Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"8", GitVersion:"v1.8.0", GitCommit:"6e937839ac04a38cac63e6a7a306c5d035fe7b0a", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2017-09-28T22:57:57Z", GoVersion:"go1.8.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

==== Install kops

Install kops using the following:

  curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
  chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
  sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops

Complete installation instructions are available at https://github.com/kubernetes/kops#installing.

The latest and prior versions of kops can be downloaded from https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases.

==== Clone the repo

The workshop repo has configuration files that are used to create Kubernetes resources.  You need to clone the repo to have access to those files:

  $ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes

At this point, you should have everything you need to complete any of the section of the this workshop using your Cloud9 Environment.

=== Automated Deployment using CloudFormation

You can also use CloudFormation templates to create the Cloud9 development environment. The template will create the Cloud9 IDE, IAM Role required for kops and S3 bucket for kops state store.

To open Cloud9 IDE environment, click on Output tab in CloudFormation Console and open Cloud9 URL

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/ide/<EnvironmentId>


==== Build script

Once your Cloud9 is ready, download the build script and install in your IDE. This will prepare your IDE for running tutorials in this workshop. The build script will install the following,

- jq
- kubectl
- kops
- configures AWS CLI and stores variables in bash_profile (for ex: AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES, KOPS_STATE_STORE etc)
- creates an SSH key
- clone's workshop repository into Cloud9

Run these commands in your Cloud9 IDE

  aws s3 cp s3://aws-kubernetes-artifacts/lab-ide-build.sh .
  chmod +x lab-ide-build.sh
  . ./lab-ide-build.sh

One last step is required so that Cloud9 IDE uses assigned IAM Instance profile. Open Cloud9 preferences and go to AWS Settings to disable AWS managed temporary credential as depicted in the diagram

=== Workshop cleanup

==== Delete kubernetes cluster resources

In your Cloud9 IDE, check if there are any running kubernetes cluster

  kops get cluster

Delete kubernetes cluster

  kops delete cluster example.cluster.k8s.local --yes

Wait until all resources are deleted by kops

==== Delete Cloud9

Go to CloudFormation console, right click template with name 'k8s-workshop' and select #Delete Stack

This should delete all the resources associated with this workshop
