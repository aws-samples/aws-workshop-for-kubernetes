= Kubernetes Application Update
:toc:

This chapter explains how an application deployed in a Kubernetes cluster can be updated using link:../developer-concepts#deployment[Deployment]. It also explains Canary Deployment of an application.

Deployment create Replica Set for managing pods. The number of replicas in the Replica Set can be scaled up and down to meet the demands of your application. Updating an application deployed using Deployment requires to update the configuration of Deployment. This modification creates a new Replica Set, which is scaled up while the previous Replica Set is scaled down. This enables no downtime for your application.

NOTE: There is a `kubectl rolling-update` command but it is applicable only to Replica Set. The update from this command was driven on the client-side. It is strongly recommended to do rolling update using Deployment as the updates are now on the server-side.

For our usecase, the application initially uses the image `arungupta/app-upgrade:v1`. Then the Deployment is updated to use the image `arungupta/app-upgrade:v2`. The v1 image prints "`Hello World!`". The v2 image prints "`Howdy World!`". The source code for these images is in the link:images[] directory.

== Prerequisites

This chapter uses a cluster with 3 master nodes and 5 worker nodes as described here: link:../cluster-install#multi-master-multi-node-multi-az-gossip-based-cluster[multi-master, multi-node gossip based cluster].

All configuration files for this chapter are in the `app-udpate` directory. Make sure you change to that directory before giving any commands in this chapter.

== Update and Rollback

=== Update to a new revision

Updating an application requires to replace all the existing pods with new pods that use a different version of the image. `.spec.strategy` in the Deployment configuration can be used to define strategy used to replace the old pods with the new ones. This key can take two values:

. `Recreate`
. `RollingUpdate` (default)

Let's look at these two deployment strategies.

==== Recreate strategy

All existing pods are killed before the new ones are created. The configuration file looks like:

    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: app-recreate
    spec:
      replicas: 5
      strategy:
        type: Recreate
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            name: app-recreate
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: app-recreate
            image: arungupta/app-upgrade:v1
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

. Create deployment:

    $ kubectl create -f templates/app-recreate.yaml --record
    deployment "app-recreate" created
+
`--record` ensures that the command initiating this deployment is recorded. This is useful when the application has gone through a few updates and you need to correlate a version with the command.
+
. Get the history of deployments:

    $ kubectl rollout history deployment/app-recreate
    deployments "app-recreate"
    REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
    1         kubectl create --filename=templates/app-recreate.yaml --record=true

. Expose service:

    $ kubectl expose deployment/app-recreate --port=80 --target-port=8080 --name=app-recreate --type=LoadBalancer
    service "app-recreate" exposed

. Get service detail:

    $ kubectl describe svc/app-recreate
    Name:                     app-recreate
    Namespace:                default
    Labels:                   name=app-recreate
    Annotations:              <none>
    Selector:                 name=app-recreate

. Acccess service:

    $ curl http://af2dc1f99bda211e791f402037f18a54-1616925381.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    Hello World!
+
The output shows that `v1` version of the image is being used.
+
. In a different terminal, watch the status of the pods:

    $ kubectl get -w pods
    app-v1-recreate-486400321-4rwzb   1/1       Running   0          9m

    app-v1-recreate-486400321-z89nm   1/1       Running   0          9m

. Update image of the deployment:

    $ kubectl set image deployment/app-recreate app-recreate=arungupta/app-upgrade:v2
    deployment "app-recreate" image updated

. Status of the pods is updated. It shows that all the pods are terminated first, and then the new ones are created:

+
The output shows that all pods are terminatd first and then the new ones are created.
+
. Get the history of deployments:

    $ kubectl rollout history deployment/app-recreate
    deployments "app-recreate"
    REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
    1         kubectl create --filename=templates/app-recreate.yaml --record=true
    2         kubectl set image deployment/app-recreate app-recreate=arungupta/app-upgrade:v2

. Access the application again:

    $ curl http://af2dc1f99bda211e791f402037f18a54-1616925381.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    Howdy World!
+
The output now shows `v2` version of the image is being used.

==== Rolling update strategy

Pods are updated in a rolling update fashion.

Two optional properties can be used to define how rolling update is performed:

. `.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge` specifies the maximum number of pods that can be created over the desired number of pods. The value can be an absolute number or percentage. Default value is `25%`.
. `.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable` specifies the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update process.

The configuration file looks like:

    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: app-rolling
    spec:
      replicas: 5
      strategy:
        type: RollingUpdate
        rollingUpdate:
          maxSurge: 1
          maxUnavailable: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            name: app-rolling
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: app-rolling
            image: arungupta/app-upgrade:v1
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

In this case, 1 more pod can be created over the maximum number of pods and only 1 pod can be unavailable during the update process.

. Create deployment:

    $ kubectl create -f templates/app-rolling.yaml --record
    deployment "app-rolling" created
+
Once again, `--record` ensures that the command initiating this deployment is recorded. This is useful when the application has gone through a few updates and you need to correlate a version with the command.

    $ kubectl rollout history deployment/app-rolling
    deployments "app-rolling"
    REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
    1         kubectl create --filename=templates/app-rolling.yaml --record=true

. Expose service:

    $ kubectl expose deployment/app-rolling --port=80 --target-port=8080 --name=app-rolling --type=LoadBalancer
    service "app-rolling" exposed

. Get service detail:

    $ kubectl describe svc/app-rolling

The output shows that a new pod is created, then an old one is terminated, then a new pod is created and so on.

. Get the history of deployments:

    $ kubectl rollout history deployment/app-rolling
    deployments "app-rolling"
    REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
    1         kubectl create --filename=templates/app-rolling.yaml --record=true
    2         kubectl set image deployment/app-rolling app-rolling=arungupta/app-upgrade:v2

. Access the application again:

    $ curl http://abe27b4c7bdaa11e791f402037f18a54-647142678.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    Howdy World!
+
The output now shows `v2` version of the image is being used.

=== Rollback to a previous revision

As discussed above, details about how a Deployment was rolled out can be obtained using `kubectl rollout history` command. In order to rollback, lets get the complete history of Deployment:

    $ kubectl rollout history deployment/app-rolling
    deployments "app-rolling"
    REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
    1         kubectl create --filename=templates/app-rolling.yaml --record=true
    2         kubectl set image deployment/app-rolling app-rolling=arungupta/app-upgrade:v2

Roll back to a previous version using the command:

    $ kubectl rollout undo deployment/app-rolling --to-revision=1
    deployment "app-rolling" rolled back

Now access the service again:

    $ curl http://abe27b4c7bdaa11e791f402037f18a54-647142678.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    Hello World!

The output shows that `v1` version of the image is now being used.

=== Delete resources

Delete resources created in this chapter:

    kubectl delete deployment/app-recreate svc/app-recreate deployment/app-rolling svc/app-rolling

== Canary deployment

Canary deployment allows to deploy a new version of the application in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users before rolling it out to everybody.

There are multiple ways to achieve this in Kubernetes:

. Using Service, Deployment and Labels
. Using Ingress Controller
. Using DNS Controller
. https://istio.io/blog/canary-deployments-using-istio.html[Using Istio] or https://buoyant.io/2016/11/04/a-service-mesh-for-kubernetes-part-iv-continuous-deployment-via-traffic-shifting/[Linkerd]

At this time, only one means of Canary deployment is explained. Details on other methods will be added later.

=== Deployment, Service and Labels

Two Deployments with image for different versions are used togther. Both Deployments have same pod labels but differ in at least one label. The common pod labels are uesd as selector for the Service. Different pod labels are used to scale the number of replicas. One replica of the new version of Deployment is released alongside the old version. If no errors are detected for some time, then the number of replicas of the new version are scaled up and the number of replicas for the old version are scaled down. Eventually, the old version is deleted.

==== Deployment and Service definition

Let's look at version `v1` of the Deployment:

    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: app-v1
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            name: app
            version: v1
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: app
            image: arungupta/app-upgrade:v1
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

It uses `arungupta/app-upgrade:v1` image. It has two labels `name: app` and `version: v1`.

Let's look at version `v2` of the Deployment:

    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: app-v2
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            name: app
            version: v2
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: app
            image: arungupta/app-upgrade:v2
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

It uses a different image, i.e. `arungupta/app-upgrade:v2`. It has one label, `name: app`, that matches the `v1` version of the Deployment. It has another label that is similar to `v2` but uses a different value, i.e. `version: v2`. This label allows to independently scale this Deployment, without overriding `v1` version of the Deployment.

Finally, let's look at the service definition that uses these Deployments:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: app-service
    spec:
      selector:
        name: app
      ports:
      - name: app
        port: 80
      type: LoadBalancer

The Service uses labels that are common to both versions of the application. This allows the pods from both Deployment to be part of the Service.

Let's verify.

==== Create Canary Deployment

. Deploy `v1` version of Deployment:

    $ kubectl apply -f templates/app-v1.yaml
    deployment "app-v1" created

. Deploy `v2` version of Deployment:

    $ kubectl apply -f templates/app-v2.yaml
    deployment "app-v2" created

. Deploy Service:

    $ kubectl apply -f templates/app-service.yaml
    service "app-service" created

. Check the list of pods for this service:

    $ kubectl get pods -l name=app
    NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    app-v1-3101668686-4mhcj   1/1       Running   0          2m
    app-v1-3101668686-ncbfv   1/1       Running   0          2m
    app-v2-2627414310-89j1v   1/1       Running   0          2m
    app-v2-2627414310-bgg1t   1/1       Running   0          2m
+
Note that we are explicitly specifying the label `name=app` in the query to only pick the pods that are specified in the service definition at `templates/app-service.yaml`. There are two pods from `v1` version and 2 pods from `v2` version. Accessing this service will have 50% response from `v1` version and the other 50% from `v2` version.

==== Scale Canary Deployment

The number of pods to be included from `v1` version and `v2` version can now be indepently scaled using the two Deployments.

. Increase the number of replicas for `v2` Deployment:

    $ kubectl scale deploy/app-v2 --replicas=4
    deployment "app-v2" scaled

. Check the pods that are part of the Service:

    $ kubectl get pods -l name=app
    NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    app-v1-3101668686-4mhcj   1/1       Running   0          6m
    app-v1-3101668686-ncbfv   1/1       Running   0          6m
    app-v2-2627414310-89j1v   1/1       Running   0          6m
    app-v2-2627414310-8jpzd   1/1       Running   0          7s
    app-v2-2627414310-b17v8   1/1       Running   0          7s
    app-v2-2627414310-bgg1t   1/1       Running   0          6m
+
You can see that 4 pods are now coming from `v2` version of the application and 2 pods are coming from `v1` version of the application. So, two-thirds traffic from the user will now be served from the new application.
+
. Reduce the number of replicas for `v1` version to 0:

    $ kubectl scale deploy/app-v1 --replicas=0
    deployment "app-v1" scaled

. Check the pods that are part of the Service:

    $ kubectl get pods -l name=app
    NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    app-v2-2627414310-89j1v   1/1       Running   0          8m
    app-v2-2627414310-8jpzd   1/1       Running   0          1m
    app-v2-2627414310-b17v8   1/1       Running   0          1m
    app-v2-2627414310-bgg1t   1/1       Running   0          8m
+
Now all pods are serving `v2` version of the Deployment.

==== Delete Canary Deployment

Run this command to delete all resource created above:

    $ kubectl delete svc/app-service deployment/app-v1 deployment/app-v2

=== Ingress Controller (Not Yet Implemented)

Achieving the right percentage of traffic using Deployments and Services requires spinning-up as many pods as necessary. For example, if the version `v1` has 4 replicas of a pod. Then, in order to direct 5% traffic to the version `v2`, 1 pod replica of `v2` version would require 16 more replicas of `v1` version. This is not an optimal usage of resource. Weighted traffic switching with Kubernetes Ingress can be used to solve this problem.

https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kube-ingress-aws-controller[Kubernetes Ingress Controller for AWS], by Zalando, is an ingress controller for Kubernetes.

    $ kubectl apply -f templates/ingress-controller.yaml
    deployment "app-ingress-controller" created
