https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[Horizontal Pod Autoscaling] (HPA) is a Kubernetes feature to dynamically increase/decrease the number of pod replicas based on resource utilization metrics.

As of k8s version 1.9, the direction for HPA is to use the Metrics Server rather than https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster[Heapster].

HPA can automatically scale pods deployed in a replication controller, deployment, or a replica set. For additional information on how HPA works, check out the Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[community documentation].

== Prerequisites

In order to perform exercises in this chapter, youâ€™ll need to deploy configurations to a Kubernetes cluster. To create an EKS-based Kubernetes cluster, use the link:../../01-path-basics/102-your-first-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-eks[AWS CLI] (recommended). If you wish to create a Kubernetes cluster without EKS, you can instead use link:../../01-path-basics/102-your-first-cluster#alternative-create-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-kops[kops].

Deploy the metrics server:

    $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kops/master/addons/metrics-server/v1.8.x.yaml

== Deploy an application

In this step, we deploy a simple Go web application and constrain the CPU resources just for the purposes of this test.

    $ kubectl run webapp --image=trevorrobertsjr/webapp --requests=cpu=50m --expose --port=8080
    service "webapp" created
    deployment "webapp" created

It also publishes the service at port 8080.

== Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration

Now that our application is running, we create a Horizonal Pod Autoscaler for our webapp deployment.

    $ kubectl autoscale deployment webapp --cpu-percent=10 --min=1 --max=10
    deployment "webapp" autoscaled

This command will mainain between 1 and 10 replicas of the pod. The autoscaler will increase or decrease the number of replicas to maintain average CPU utilization of 10% across all the pods.

== Generate load

The simplest method to do this would be to access the application in an infinite loop similar to the example in the Kubernetes Horizonal Pod Autoscaler documentation:

First, deploy a busybox container, label it `load-generator` and attach to it's prompt:

    $ kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --image=busybox /bin/sh

At the `load-generator` command prompt, run a continuous request of the webapp

    $ while true; do wget -q -O- http://webapp.default.svc.cluster.local:8080; done

If for any reason you get disconnected from the load-generator container, you can re-attach to it with the following command.

    $ kubectl attach $(kubectl get pod | grep load | awk '{print $1}') -c load-generator -i -t

In a different terminal window, check the status of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

    $ kubectl get hpa -w

You will see output similar to the following over successive queries of the hpa resource:

    $ kubectl get hpa -w
    NAME      REFERENCE           TARGETS    MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
    webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        1          6m
    webapp    Deployment/webapp   62% / 10%   1         10        1         7m
    webapp    Deployment/webapp   62% / 10%   1         10        4         7m
    webapp    Deployment/webapp   112% / 10%   1         10        4         8m
    webapp    Deployment/webapp   112% / 10%   1         10        4         8m
    webapp    Deployment/webapp   53% / 10%   1         10        4         9m


Notice that, eventually, the value in the `REPLICAS` column will increase as the load generator continues to run.

== Stop load

In the terminal window that is running the load generator, hit `Ctrl`+`C` to terminate the process. Again, run the `kubectl get hpa -w` command in your other terminal window, and you will see the number of replicas begin to decrease as the CPU load returns to 0%. It shows the output:

NOTE: It takes a few minutes for the number of replicas to scale down.

```
$ kubectl get hpa -w
NAME      REFERENCE           TARGETS     MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
webapp    Deployment/webapp   51% / 10%   1         10        4          10m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   51% / 10%   1         10        4         10m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   27% / 10%   1         10        4         11m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   27% / 10%   1         10        8         11m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        8         12m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        8         12m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        8         13m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        8         13m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        8         14m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        8         14m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        8         15m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        8         15m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        8         16m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        1         16m
webapp    Deployment/webapp   0% / 10%   1         10        1         17m
```

== Cleanup

    $ kubectl delete hpa/webapp deploy/load-generator deploy/webapp
